If yer trying to bring in a new sheriff to the wild, wild west of your legacy codebase,
there's gonna be some outlaws that are just too ornery to contend with. Better to just
leave those scoundrels be that aren't in your crosshairs and let yer deputies focus on
what's at hand.

This gem presumes yer a-usin' git for yer revisionin' purposes. For now, it also figgers
yer always branchin' from origin/master, which, I know, I know, that ain't always how ever'body
out here on the frontier likes to operate, but hey, we're just gettin' started here.

Also, you should know goin' in that we're duck punchin' into a sweet spot of the Rubocop
underbelly, and well, we just may get to fightin' in the future if them Rubocop folk
get some fancy refactorin' ideas.

Not to mention that some o' yer tougher deputies may get sidelined if they need more than
a changed line to do thar job ... we'll just have to see about all that down the road.  

I'm not sure how we fell into a old western theme here with a modern robot-type gem, but
sometimes ... well, sometimes, the bear eats you.    

## Installation

Add this to yer Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rubocop_lineup'
```

And then bundle that up:

    $ bundle

Or just put it in with all yer other gems if so inclined:

    $ gem install rubocop_lineup

## Usage

To use it regular-like, add this to the
[require section](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/blob/master/manual/extensions.md#loading-extensions)
of .rubocop.yml:

```yaml
   require:
   - rubocop_lineup
```

If you only need to use it ever' now-n-again, inform yer rubocop with the
`-r rubocop_lineup` option.
